# Wrangling1
Wrangling Austin Texas Water Quality Dataset Using Pandas and Seaborn Libraries exclusively.

## Introduction
This data was collected from  the [austin water quality page](https://data.austintexas.gov/Environment/Water-Quality-Sampling-Data/5tye-7ray). It comprises of physicochemical analyses of water parameters collected from different sources within the Austin area, Texas, United States. For this wrangling project, the author used Pandas for the gathering, assessment, cleaning phases and Seaborn for visualisation.

## Quality and Tidiness Issues Addressed

## Wrangling Efforts
- Wrong datatypes were converted to their appropriate types
- Valid units were given to specific parameters
- Units were converted to ensure uniformity
- Outliers were removed
- Duplicates were removed
- Each observational unit was made to form a table

## Limitations
In order to respect the original work performed using R. The author (who performed his using Python) reduced the amount of outliers present but decided to leave out some since those were the decisions of the first author.
